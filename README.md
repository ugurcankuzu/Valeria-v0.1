# Valeria-v0.1
<h1>Non-ML Supported Personal Assistant (ML Support will be available soon.)</h1>

Valeria can do daily routines for me and specialized for this. It's just a prototype for newer versions. 

Valeria doesn't have ML technology for now but newer versions will include ML. 

Valeria's Voice Recognition works with NLP algorithm.
